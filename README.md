Laravel package for integration with the Zoho v3 API (CRM + Books + Inventory) with multi-organization token support.

## Installation

Install the package via Composer:

```bash
composer require masmaleki/zoho-one
```

Publish and run the migrations:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="zoho-one-migrations"
php artisan migrate
```

Publish the config file:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="zoho-one-config"
```

The config is published to `config/zoho-one.php`. Reference values in your app via `config('zoho-one.*')`.

## Upgrading from `masmaleki/zoho-v3` or `masmaleki/zoho-v4`

This package was previously published as `masmaleki/zoho-v3` and briefly as `masmaleki/zoho-v4`.
The package name no longer carries a version suffix; the underlying database table is still
named `zoho_v4` (it is an internal implementation detail and is not renamed again to avoid
forcing another migration on existing installs).

To upgrade:

1. Swap the Composer requirement:

    ```bash
    composer remove masmaleki/zoho-v3   # or masmaleki/zoho-v4
    composer require masmaleki/zoho-one
    ```

2. Publish and run the migrations. Two guarded upgrade migrations ship with the package
   (both are idempotent and safe to re-run):

    ```bash
    php artisan vendor:publish --tag="zoho-one-migrations"
    php artisan migrate
    ```

   - `rename_zoho_v3_to_zoho_v4_table` renames the legacy `zoho_v3` table to `zoho_v4`
     (no-op if you are already on `zoho_v4` or on a fresh install).
   - `add_organization_id_to_zoho_v4_table` adds the `organization_id` column required by
     the multi-organization feature (no-op if already present).

3. Re-publish the config (it has been renamed to `config/zoho-one.php`) and copy any
   custom values from your old `config/zoho-v3.php` or `config/zoho-v4.php`:

    ```bash
    php artisan vendor:publish --tag="zoho-one-config"
    ```

   Update any `config('zoho-v3.*')` or `config('zoho-v4.*')` calls in your application
   code to `config('zoho-one.*')`.
